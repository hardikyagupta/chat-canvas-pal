/**
 * Co-marketer suggestion strip above the Segments table (Figma node 5639:44292)
 * — a tinted panel with four prompt cards the user can fire straight into the
 * co-marketer chat.
 *
 * Each card shows a short headline + one-line description instead of the raw
 * prompt (the full prompt still goes to the chat via `prompt`), plus badges
 * that say what the segment is worth before the user commits to a click.
 *
 * The peach border carries the same rotating conic stroke animation as the AI
 * homepage chat input (`.input-border-shimmer` in index.css), offset per card so
 * the four rings sweep out of phase instead of in lockstep.
